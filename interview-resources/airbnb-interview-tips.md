# Detailed Interview Prep Guide

Use this as a comprehensive breakdown of every interview round, based directly on the email you received. Each section covers **environment**, **evaluation criteria**, **core topics**, and **specific tips**.

## 1. Frontend Coding Interviews (2 × 45 min)

### Environment & Setup
- **Your laptop**: Choose your own machine so you’re comfortable.
- **Tooling**: Install any IDEs, language runtimes, linters, or your personal dotfiles **in advance**.
- **Remote**: You’ll share your screen over Zoom—test your audio, video, and screen-share permissions beforehand.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Communication**
    - **Lead the conversation**: Narrate your thought process (“I’m going to approach it like this…”).
    - **Take feedback**: Pause when the interviewer interjects; confirm you heard them (“Got it—so you’d like me to…?”).
    - **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language. Ask “Does that make sense?” whenever you switch context.

2. **Code Quality**
    - **Correctness & Testing**: Write working examples; include edge-case checks.
    - **Modularity**: Break your solution into functions or classes with single responsibilities.
    - **Readability**: Use descriptive names, consistent indentation, and comments for non-obvious logic.
    - **Optimization**: Avoid O(N²) loops when O(N) or O(N log N) is possible; use built-in data structures appropriately.

3. **Logical Reasoning**
    - **Justify every step**: “I chose this loop because…”
    - **Detail over buzzwords**: Instead of “I’ll memoize,” say “I’ll store results in a hash to avoid recomputing.”
    - **Walk through examples**: Dry-run your code on a small test case out loud.

4. **Execution**
    - **Respect constraints**: Honor input sizes or API shapes your interviewer specifies.
    - **Iterate**: Start with a brute-force solution, then discuss how to optimize if time permits.
    - **Ask clarifying questions**: If they say “assume inputs fit memory,” confirm before designing an external-memory solution.

### Core Frontend Concepts
You may be asked to **implement** or **explain** any of these:

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**
    - *Inheritance*: Prototypal vs. class-based patterns.
    - *Closures*: Lexical scope, preserving state across calls.
    - *Event Loop*: Macro-tasks vs. micro-tasks, call stacks, task queues.
    - *Callbacks & Promises*: Chaining, error handling, `async`/`await`.
    - *Currying*: Partial application for reusable functions.

- **Design Patterns & Best Practices**
    - Module pattern, Observer, Singleton, Factory.
    - Performance: Debouncing/throttling, virtual DOM diffing.
    - Network: Efficient batching, caching strategies, HTTP/2 multiplexing.

- **Markup & Styling**
    - Semantic HTML: `<header>`, `<nav>`, ARIA roles for accessibility.
    - CSS Layouts: Flexbox, Grid, responsive breakpoints.
    - Animations: `@keyframes`, `transition`, performance pitfalls (layout thrashing).

- **Accessibility (a11y)**
    - Keyboard navigation, screen-reader labels (`aria-`), color contrast ratios.
    - Common gotchas: Focus management in modals, form labels.

- **Internationalization (i18n)**
    - RTL layout considerations, date/number formatting, locale-specific UI.

- **Refresher Topics**
    - Browser events (`click`, `DOMContentLoaded`), event delegation.
    - DOM manipulation APIs vs. modern frameworks.
    - CSS pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`), semantic markup benefits.

## 2. Architecture / System Design Interview (60 min)

### Environment & Tools
- **Digital whiteboard**: Practice with Google Jamboard, Zoom’s Whiteboard, or Miro.
- **Screen sharing**: Ensure your resolution is clear and you can draw boxes/text legibly.

### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Communication**
    - Confirm requirements before diving in: “To clarify, the system must…?”
    - Keep interviewer in the loop: “Here’s my high-level approach—does that align?”

2. **Trade-Off Analysis**
    - Propose multiple options (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL), then justify your pick.
    - Highlight downsides: “Using a relational DB gives us ACID but makes schema migrations harder.”

3. **Technical Curiosity**
    - Ask about scale limits, expected traffic patterns, data retention rules.
    - Clarify scope: “Should we target 99.9% availability, or can we accept occasional downtime?”

4. **Logical Reasoning**
    - Define your assumptions explicitly.
    - Avoid vague buzzwords—explain “sharding” (“hash user ID to distribute across nodes”).

5. **Execution**
    - Stay within stated constraints.
    - Prioritize core functionality before advanced optimizations.

### 3-Step Framework

1. **Clarify & Scope**
    - Restate the problem, ask about major features, define non-functional targets.
    - Example: “We need feed latency under 200 ms for up to 1 M requests/sec?”

2. **High-Level Design**
    - Sketch major components: API gateway, service tier, database, cache, message bus.
    - Get buy-in before drilling down.

3. **Deep Dive & Bottlenecks**
    - Focus on one critical path (e.g., “user feed” ingestion and fan-out).
    - Identify potential bottlenecks (e.g., cold cache misses, single-threaded queues).

4. **Wrap-Up**
    - Summarize your design, revisit trade-offs, propose improvements (e.g., circuit breakers, autoscaling rules).

## 3. Technical Experience Interview (60 min)

### Format & Goal
- **Project Deep-Dive**: Walk through one significant system you built.
- **Objective**: Showcase impact, technical depth, and cross-functional collaboration.

### Must-Have Elements
1. **Business Need**
    - What problem were you solving? Why did it matter (metrics)?
2. **Technical Decisions & Trade-Offs**
    - Architecture choices (microservices vs. monolith), technology stacks.
    - Alternatives you considered and why you chose your solution.
3. **Outcome & Learnings**
    - Quantifiable impact (e.g., reduced latency by 40%, improved dev-ops cycle time).
    - What you’d do differently next time.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Impact & Scope**
    - Scale of users or data; organizational leadership (mentoring, coordination).
- **Communication**
    - Clear storytelling: context → challenge → solution → result.
- **Collaboration & Autonomy**
    - How you drove projects end-to-end, worked with product/ops/design teams.
- **Expertise**
    - Depth of your domain knowledge: full lifecycle from design to production to monitoring.
- **Technical Quality**
    - Consideration of non-functional requirements: performance, maintainability, cost; observability (metrics, logging, alerts).

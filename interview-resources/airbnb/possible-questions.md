# Airbnb Interview Prep: Sample Questions

Use this as a guide to the types of questions Airbnb has asked in each interview round.

## 1. Frontend Coding Interviews (2×45 min)

*Implement & debug UI components under time constraints, both in vanilla JS and framework-agnostic contexts.*

- **Build a Tabs component**: render tabs, switch panels, manage active state; include ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
- **Create a Star-Rating widget**: display ★ stars, support half-stars, handle click/hover events.
- **Implement a Backbone-style Model class**: key-value store with `.get`/`.set`, `.on('change',…)`, `.trigger(…)`.
- **Algorithmic debugging**: troubleshoot API errors in a small app; implement retry logic for fetch failures.
- **JS fundamentals deep-dive**: explain closures, event loop, promises vs. callbacks, inheritance, currying.
- **HTML/CSS mockup**: convert designs to responsive layouts; use Flexbox/Grid, semantic markup, basic animations.

## 2. Architecture / System Design Interview (60 min)

*Whiteboard large-scale services—focus on Airbnb-style features such as bookings, search, payments, and availability.*

- **Design an Airbnb-like booking system**: property listings → search → availability → reservations → payments → confirmations; ensure consistency and manage inventory.

- **High availability & fault tolerance**: leader-follower replication, circuit breakers, retry policies, multi-region failover.  [oai_citation_attribution:4‡YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&v=i7twT3x5yv8&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Airbnb Wallet design**: ACID in distributed ledger, idempotency, at-least-once delivery.  [oai_citation_attribution:5‡GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharanyaa/grok_sdi_educative/master/grok_system_design_interview.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
